# Auto-Filler-for-Resume
Many job portals still donâ€™t have any AI auto-form completion; even if they do, they fail on resumes made with templates. This causes job applicants to fill out and correct the forms, creating a time-consuming activity.
This project is dedicated to creating an OCR software that recognizes text and patterns on
resumes and CVs to auto-complete application forms. It is found that many job applicants
bounce off job portals with manual forms, so to address this problem we will parse out their
resumes.
